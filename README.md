# Simple MVC starter for any PHP based project

## Installation
1. If you decide to pull the repo at the root of your www/ please modify config variables located at config/config.php
1. Else you can pull the repo to a subdirectory, for developement I used a subdirectory so www/starter_mvc will already work
1. IF you didn't pull the vendor folder : you will need to install one package, if you aren't used to composer, please refer to composer documentation for a quick project setup (https://getcomposer.org/download/)
1. To install dependancies, please simply use in order :
```
composer install
composer dump-autoload
```
Thank you for using this php starter app :smile:	

## Setup
1. You can use a local server such as [Wamp](https://wampserver.com/) or [Mamp](https://www.mamp.info/) or any server installation you want
1. Pull the repo in the `www/` directory of your local server
1. Follow the address of your repo. For example, if your repo is in ``www/starter_mvc/``, the URL should be http://127.0.0.1/starter_mvc
